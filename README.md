To use it, simply put your pictures into the images folder, running the program will output them into compressed folder.

There are two parameters, resize ratio where you can change the resolution of the picture from 0-1, 0.5 would be half the resolution. Quality 0-100, higher the number better the quality.

Supports jpg, jpeg, and png.
